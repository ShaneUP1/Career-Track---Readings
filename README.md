# Career-Track---Readings

## Quantity Trumps Quality
I think was this reading is ultimately trying to convey is that sometimes when we're so focused on making the perfect things, we waste an inordinate amount of time trying to nail down what that is before ever actually doing anything. Paralysis by analysis if you will. The other takeaway for me from this reading is that quality, with most skills/crafts, comes with repetition. Repetition in this case demonstrated by quantity.

## Clean Code - Chapter 1
Messy code makes everything take longer. In the beginning it's typically accepted as okay to meet deadlines etc. but rarely is this the actual case. In fact often times deadlines are still not met and once the code quality starts getting sacrificed for finishing it only gets worse. As code gets more and more messy it takes longer and longer to do things that should have only taken a few hours. This is very much a snowball effect.
Clean written code accomplishes one thing really well. It's simple and reads like well written prose. It should be clear in it's decision making, easily enhanced by others, and tested. Clean code appears to have been written by someone who cares. When it is read by others it should be obvious and absolutely what was expected with nothing extra, espeically duplications.
Keep in mind that code is read 10 times more often than it is written. This is important because if you're trying to enchance existing code and you can't even read it how can you possible make it better? It's not enough to only focus on this in the beginning, but also important to keep the code clean over time. Leave code cleaner than when you arrived.

## Destructuring Assignment
Destructuring allows us to unpack itesm from arrays and objects into distinct variables. We can assign default values as well as swap and rearrange the values, we can ignore values, assign a portion of them to an array.
## Spread
Spread allows us to expand arrays or objects into their individual items in places that are expecting 0 or more values. This also makes it easier to combine parts of arrays with other arrays using minimal code. With objects it allows us to combine properties of one object with those of another, or clone the object all together without writing it all out again.
## Rest
Rest kind of does the opposite of Spread, now we take an indefinite number of variables and we combine them into one array that utilizes all the normal array properties. One catch to this is that only the last parameter can be a rest parameter.
